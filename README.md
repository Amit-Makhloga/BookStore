#Overview:

The BookStore project is a full-stack web application designed to emulate an online bookstore. It enables users to browse through a collection of books and perform purchases. The application also incorporates user authentication, allowing users to create accounts and log in to access personalized features.

#Features

User Authentication:

Sign Up: New users can create an account by providing their full name, email, and password. The password is securely hashed before storage to ensure user security.
Log In: Existing users can log in using their email and password. The system verifies credentials by comparing the provided password with the hashed password stored in the database.
Book Management:

Browse Books: Users can view a list of available books, each displaying its name, price, category, image, and title.
Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS:

The frontend is styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive and modern user interface across various devices and screen sizes.
